# Music-Notes-Transposer
## A simple java code I did for funsies. 

Whilst playing some Roblox game called, "Visual Pianos", I've found an idea to make this. From keyboard notes to actual notes on the piano in which you can use to transpose as well! Specifically so that I can write them easier on paper.

<b>Piano Class </b> — <i>keyboard keys to piano keys</i>
<br><b>Keys Class </b> — <i>for transposing keyboard keys</i>
